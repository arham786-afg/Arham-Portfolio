# 🧠 Mohammed Bilaal Arham —AI-Assisted Detection & Respons CyberSecurity Engineer
> Interactive cybersecurity portfolio simulating SOC escalation logic, AI-assisted investigations, and automation-first response workflows.

---

## 🔎 Overview

This portfolio is designed as a live, interactive representation of how I approach detection engineering and incident response in enterprise environments.

Instead of a static resume page, this project demonstrates:

- SOC war-room simulation
- AI confidence-based escalation modeling
- Playbook-driven containment actions
- Threat intelligence enrichment logic
- Investigation philosophy in terminal format
- Operator-focused skill visualization

This is not a template portfolio.  
It is an engineering-driven representation of operational thinking.
